# Welcome to Dowser 

The goal of Dowser is to simplify the process of searching for popular attractions within the user’s local ecosystem. By mining the FourSquare API, we were able to base our data visualization on the number of total checkins at a particular establishment. Our map displays each venue with a circle where the radius representative of total checkins, while the color of the boarder indicates a rating out of 10 stars. This allows users to easily pinpoint their experience; a local may want to try a newer venue with fewer check-ins and positive ratings, while a visitor is more likely to choose a ‘staple’ attraction with many check-ins. Users are able to see a detailed view of venues by clicking marker tooltip and save places to their favorites list.
