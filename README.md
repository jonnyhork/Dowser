# Welcome to Dowser 

The goal of Dowser is to simplify the process of searching for and indentifing popular attractions around the users current location. By mining the FourSquare API, we were able to base our data visualization on the number of total check-ins at a particular establishment. Our map displays each venue with a circle where the radius represents total check-ins, while the color of the border indicates a rating out of 10 stars. This allows users to easily pinpoint their experience; a local may want to try a newer venue with fewer check-ins and positive ratings, while a visitor is more likely to choose a ‘staple’ attraction with many check-ins. Users are able to see a detailed view of venues by clicking a marker tooltip and save places to their favorites list.
